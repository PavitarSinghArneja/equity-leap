## 💡 The Opportunity

### **The Problem You Face:**

```
Traditional Property Sale:
├─ Takes 6-12 months to find ONE buyer
├─ Broker commission: 2-3% (₹30-45L on ₹15Cr property)
├─ Price negotiation: Lose 5-10%
├─ Buyer funding issues delay closing
├─ Legal paperwork: 2-3 months
└─ Stressful, uncertain process
```

### **Our Solution:**

```
Fractional Sale via Equity Leap:
├─ Listed to 12,500+ investors in 48 hours
├─ No broker commission: Save ₹30-45L
├─ Premium pricing: Get 15-20% more
├─ Multiple buyers: Faster execution
├─ We handle ALL paperwork
└─ Money in bank: 30-45 days
```

### **Real Example:**

```
Property: Commercial Office, Mumbai
Traditional Sale:
├─ Market value: ₹15 Crores
├─ Broker fee: -₹45 Lakhs (3%)
├─ Negotiation: -₹75 Lakhs (5%)
├─ Net to you: ₹13.80 Crores
└─ Timeline: 8-12 months

Fractional Sale (Equity Leap):
├─ Listed at: ₹17 Crores (+13% premium)
├─ Platform fee: -₹51 Lakhs (3%)
├─ Legal/SPV: -₹34 Lakhs (2%)
├─ Net to you: ₹15.15 Crores
└─ Timeline: 30-45 days

Your Benefit: +₹1.35 Crores + 10 months saved
```

---

## 🚀 Why Fractionalisation?

### **1. Access Larger Buyer Pool**

**Traditional Sale:**
```
₹15 Crore property
├─ Target buyers: Ultra HNI
├─ Pool size: ~500 people in India
├─ Finding one buyer: 6-12 months
└─ Negotiation power: With buyer
```

**Fractional Sale:**
```
₹15 Crore property = 100,000 shares @ ₹1,500
├─ Minimum investment: ₹10,000
├─ Target buyers: Middle class + HNI
├─ Pool size: 12,500+ active investors
├─ Funding: Pre-verified buyers
└─ Pricing power: With you (market demand)
```

**Result:** More buyers = Better price + Faster sale

---

### **2. Premium Pricing**

Investors pay premium because:

```
For Traditional Buyer:
₹15 Cr property
├─ Down payment: ₹3 Cr (20%)
├─ Loan: ₹12 Cr @ 9% for 20 years
├─ EMI: ₹10.8L/month
├─ Total paid: ₹25.92 Cr
└─ Effective cost: ₹25.92 Cr

For Fractional Investor:
₹1.5L investment (100 shares)
├─ No loan needed
├─ Immediate ownership
├─ Trading liquidity
├─ Diversification benefit
├─ Professional management
└─ Willing to pay 15-20% premium

Result: You get ₹17 Cr instead of ₹15 Cr
```

---

### **3. Faster Execution**

```
Traditional Timeline (8-12 months):
Month 1-3: Marketing + Finding buyer
Month 4-6: Negotiation + Due diligence
Month 7-9: Buyer arranges funding
Month 10-12: Legal + Registry
└─ 12 months of uncertainty

Equity Leap Timeline (30-45 days):
Day 1-7: Property evaluation + Legal check
Day 8-14: SPV setup + Share creation
Day 15-21: Marketing launch
Day 22-30: Investor funding (rolling)
Day 31-45: Final settlement
└─ Guaranteed timeline
```

---

### **4. No Broker Commissions**

```
₹15 Crore Property Sale:

Traditional:
├─ Broker fee: ₹45 Lakhs (3%)
├─ Your net: ₹14.55 Cr
└─ Broker does: Marketing only

Equity Leap:
├─ Platform fee: ₹51 Lakhs (3%)

## ❓ FAQs

### **Q1: How is this different from a traditional broker?**

```
Traditional Broker:
├─ Finds ONE buyer
├─ 2-3% commission
├─ 6-12 months timeline
├─ Deals often fall through
├─ Negotiation favors buyer
└─ No support after sale

Equity Leap:
├─ Finds 100-500 buyers
├─ 5% total fee (but 15-20% premium pricing)
├─ 30-45 days timeline
├─ Guaranteed funding
├─ Market-driven pricing
└─ Full legal & tech support
```

### **Q2: What if my property is in a small city?**

```
We Work Pan-India:
├─ Our investor base is nationwide
├─ Many investors seek tier-2/3 cities (better yields)
├─ Remote evaluation & documentation
├─ Same process as metro properties
└─ May take 45-60 days instead of 30-45

Best Performing Locations:
Tier-1: Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune
Tier-2: Jaipur, Chandigarh, Kochi, Indore
Tier-3: Depends on property quality & yield
```

### **Q3: Can I fractionalise agricultural land?**

```
Current Focus:
├─ Commercial properties
├─ Residential properties
├─ Retail spaces
├─ Warehouses
├─ Office spaces
└─ Mixed-use buildings

Agricultural Land:
├─ Currently not offered
├─ Regulatory restrictions
├─ Working with government for approval
└─ Notify when available

Alternative:
If land has commercial potential:
├─ Convert to commercial use
├─ Then fractionalise
└─ We can guide on conversion
```

### **Q4: What about properties with existing tenants?**

```
With Tenants (Preferred!):
├─ Better for investors (immediate rental income)
├─ Higher valuation (occupied = income-generating)
├─ Premium pricing possible
├─ Faster funding
└─ Lower risk for investors

Process:
├─ Tenant continues lease
├─ Rent shared among investors
├─ We manage tenant relationship
├─ No disruption
└─ Actually increases property value

Without Tenants:
├─ Still works fine
├─ We find tenants after fractionalisation
├─ May take 1-2 months
└─ Slightly lower valuation
```

```
Cancellation Policy:
Before marketing launch (Day 1-14):

After marketing launch (Day 15+):
