# üß† Complete User Analytics & Psychology Tracking Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview

This comprehensive analytics system tracks every meaningful user interaction to understand user psychology and provide actionable insights for your sales team. The system captures behavioral patterns, calculates engagement scores, predicts investment intent, and provides sales recommendations.

## üìä What This System Captures

### **User Psychology Insights**
- **Engagement Patterns**: How often, how long, and how deeply users interact
- **Investment Intent**: Likelihood to invest based on behavior patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Probability of user churn or disengagement
- **Research Behavior**: Deep vs. shallow browsing patterns
- **Decision Triggers**: What motivates users to take action

### **Sales Intelligence**
- **Lead Scoring**: 0-100 score based on behavior and engagement
- **Lead Temperature**: Hot/Warm/Cold classification for prioritization
- **Investment Preferences**: Property types, price ranges, locations
- **Optimal Contact Timing**: Best times for sales follow-up
- **Personalized Insights**: Custom talking points for each prospect

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Set Up Database Schema**

Run the following SQL files in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- 1. Create main tracking tables
\i USER_ACTIVITY_TRACKING_SETUP.sql

-- 2. Add helper functions and scoring algorithms
\i ANALYTICS_HELPER_FUNCTIONS.sql
```

### **Step 2: Integrate Analytics in Your React App**

1. **Add Analytics Provider to your app root:**

```tsx
// In your main App.tsx or index.tsx
import { AnalyticsProvider } from '@/hooks/useAnalytics';

function App() {
  return (
    <AnalyticsProvider>
      {/* Your existing app */}
    </AnalyticsProvider>
  );
}
```

2. **Initialize tracking in AuthContext:**

```tsx
// In your AuthContext after user login
import { analyticsService } from '@/services/AnalyticsService';

useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && user) {
    analyticsService.initialize(user);
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user]);
```

### **Step 3: Add Event Tracking to Components**

#### **Automatic Tracking (Minimal Setup)**

```tsx
// Pages automatically track page views
import { withAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useAnalytics';

const PropertyListPage = () => {
  // Component code
};

export default withAnalytics(PropertyListPage, {
  trackPageView: true,
  trackTimeSpent: true
});
```

#### **Manual Event Tracking**

```tsx
import { useAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useAnalytics';

const PropertyCard = ({ property }) => {
  const analytics = useAnalytics();

  const handlePropertyClick = () => {
    analytics.trackPropertyView(property.id, property.title);
    // Navigate to property
  };

  const handleWatchlistAdd = () => {
    analytics.trackWatchlistAdd(property.id, property.title, hasNotes);
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={handlePropertyClick}>
      {/* Property card content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### **Investment Flow Tracking**

```tsx
const InvestmentFlow = ({ propertyId, propertyTitle }) => {
  const analytics = useAnalytics();

  const handleFlowStart = (amount) => {
    analytics.trackInvestmentStart(propertyId, propertyTitle, amount);
  };

  const handleFlowComplete = (amount, paymentMethod) => {
    analytics.trackInvestmentComplete(propertyId, propertyTitle, amount, paymentMethod);
  };

  // Use in your investment flow components
};
```

### **Step 4: Set Up Admin Access**

Add the sales analytics dashboard to your admin routes:

```tsx
// In your admin routing
import SalesAnalyticsDashboard from '@/pages/admin/SalesAnalyticsDashboard';

const AdminRoutes = () => (
  <Routes>
    {/* Other admin routes */}
    <Route path="/admin/sales-analytics" element={<SalesAnalyticsDashboard />} />
  </Routes>
);
```

### **Step 5: Configure Data Aggregation**

Set up a daily cron job to aggregate analytics (via Supabase Edge Functions or your backend):

```sql
-- Run this daily at midnight
SELECT aggregate_daily_analytics();
```
