## ‚è±Ô∏è Secondary Market Scheduler

To ensure expired holds and reservations are cleaned up automatically (and funds/shares are released), add a scheduled job in Supabase:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```
-- Runs every minute
select cron.schedule(
  'expire_trading_artifacts',
  '*/1 * * * *',
  $$select public.expire_holds_and_reservations();$$
);
```

If `pg_cron` is not enabled in your project, you can use Supabase Scheduled Jobs UI to call:

```
SELECT public.expire_holds_and_reservations();
```

every minute.

This complements the new trading flow (holds/reservations) and prevents stale locks.
